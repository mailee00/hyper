	<h2><u>What in the World is Janken?</u></h2>
		<p><strong>Janken (じゃんけん)</strong> is the Japanese name for the classic <b>"rock-paper-scissors"</b> hand game played all around the world. Even though it has a different name, the rules are just the same! In Japan, <i>Janken</i> is used to make all kinds of decisions and settle disagreements, big or small. The game is so popular that the Japanese idol group AKB48 became known for holding annual <em>Janken</em> tournaments to decide which member would the center performer for their next single.</p>
		<p>Don't believe me? Watch <i title="former member of SKE48's Team KII">Rina Matsumoto</i> secure a win at a high-stakes <a href="https://youtu.be/pFaExcs_MgQ?t=55">Janken Tournament</a>.</p>
		<p>Interesting, right? Let's take a look at some of the terms in Japanese. </p>
	
	<h2><u>Starting The Game</u></h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Both players say <em>"saisho wa guu"</em> (最初はぐう) which means "Starting with rock..." and hold out a fist. </li>
		<li>Both players say <em>"janken pon!"</em> and throw their move.</li>
		<li>If there's a tie, both players say <em>"aiko desho!"</em> (相子相子) which means, "It seems like a tie!" Continue until someone wins.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Now, let's take a look at some of those killer moves and what they do.</p>
	
	<h2><u>Rock!</u></h2>
		<h3 class="sub">A Fist Strong Enough to Topple Empires</h3>
		<img src="images/rock.GIF" alt="An animated graphic of a fist with the English and Japanese words for rock." class="center">
		<p>Rock, otherwise known as <em>guu</em> (グー), is the devastating move that crushes scissors. Sadly, it's concrete exterior is no match for the suffocating grip of paper. </p>
	
	<h2><u>Paper!</u></h2>
		<h3 class="sub">A Palm Powerful Enough to Grasp Your Enemies</h3>
		<img src="images/paper.GIF" alt="An animated graphic of an open hand with the English and Japanese words for paper." class="center">
		<p>Paper, also know as <em>paa</em> (パー), is the silent but deadly strike that immobilizes rock. Unfortunately, this thin page can't hold up against the snipping might of scissors. </p>
	
	
	<h2><u>Scissors!</u></h2>
		<h3 class="sub">A Pair of Fingers Powerful Enough to Chop Down Any Obstacle</h3>
		<img src="images/scissors.GIF" alt="An animated graphic of a hand with two fingers extended with the English and Japanese words for scissors." 	class="center">
		<p>Scissors, called <em>choki</em> (チョキ), are the swift slash that vanquish paper. Regrettably, this delicate tool is unequipped to deal with the pulverizing prowess of rock. </p>
	
	<h2><u>Am I Going Too Fast?</u></h2>
		<p>Here, I'll give you a table for reference. Don't worry; it's on the house.</p>
	
	<table style="background-color:#F15BB5;">
		<tr>
			<th> </th>
			<th>Rock</th>
			<th>Paper</th>
			<th>Scissors</th>
